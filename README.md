# Kilo Text Editor

*A simple text editor written in C with no dependencies.*

I wrote this project following an [online tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/)

The tutorial is modeled after [this blog post](http://antirez.com/news/108)

This is my first project in C; what a thrill to finally get closer to the metal.
